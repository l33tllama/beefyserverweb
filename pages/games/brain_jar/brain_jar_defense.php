<p><b>Guide:</b><br/>
	It is the dystopian distant future, and the zombie apocalypse has inevitably occured. <br/>
	The future humans have created the ultimate super-computer, a bio-engineered super-brain that can think creatively like a human to respond to unique situations. <br/>
	In the game, you play as the super-brain and you must control the last defenses, a base with four remote controlled robots. <br/>
	As zombies enjoy the taste of brains, they are drawn towards the super brain. This mean more zombie killing! <br/>
	The gameplay is a hybrid of tower-defense and FPS. You can switch bewtween each robot (or TD tower) effectively moving towers around and taking control of them from the first perosn perpective. <br/>
	<br/>
	Due to limited base power, the robots have a very limited range, and cannot be moved far outside the base. Static interference indicates loss of reception.<br/>
	
						
	<br/><b>Controls:</b><br/>
	1, 2, 3, 4 - to switch between robots<br/>
	W, A, S, D - to move robots<br/ >
	Mouse to look<br/>
	Escape to pause<br/>
